            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>
               <hi>Courteous Reader,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IT is now many years ſince divers of us (with other ſober Chriſtians then living and walking in the way of the Lord that we profeſſe) did conceive our ſelves to be under a neceſſity of Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a <hi>Confeſſion of our Faith,</hi> for the information, and ſatisfaction of thoſe, that did not throughly underſtand what our principles were, or had entertained prejudices againſt our Profeſſion, by reaſon of the ſtrange repreſentation of them, by ſome men of note, who had taken very wrong meaſures, and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly
<pb facs="tcp:42012:3"/> led others into miſapprehenſions, of us, and them: and this was firſt put forth about the year, 1643. in the name of ſeven Congregations then gathered in <hi>London;</hi> ſince which time, diverſe im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions thereof have been diſperſed abroad, and our end propoſed, in good meaſure anſwered, inaſmuch as many (and ſome of thoſe men eminent, both for piety and learning) were thereby ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that we were no way guilty of thoſe Heterodoxies and fundamental er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, which had too frequently been charged upon us without ground, or oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion given on our part. And foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much, as that <hi>Confeſſion</hi> is not now com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly to be had; and alſo that many others have ſince embraced the ſame truth which is owned therein; it was judged neceſſary by us to joyn together in giving a teſtimony to the world; of our firm adhering to thoſe wholeſome Principles, by the publication of this which is now in your hand.</p>
            <p>And foraſmuch as our method, and
<pb facs="tcp:42012:3"/> manner of expreſſing our ſentiments, in this, doth vary from the former (although the ſubſtance of the matter is the ſame) we ſhall freely impart to you the reaſon and occaſion thereof. One thing that greatly prevailed with us to undertake this work, was (not only to give a full account of our ſelves, to thoſe Chriſtians that differ from us about the ſubject of Baptiſm, but alſo) the profit that might from thence ariſe, unto thoſe that have any account of our labors, in their inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and eſtabliſhment in the great truths of the Goſpel; in the clear underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſteady belief of which, our comfortable walking with God, and fruitfulneſs before him, in all our ways, is moſt neerly concerned; and therefore we did conclude it neceſſary to expreſſe our ſelves the more fully, and diſtinctly; and alſo to fix on ſuch a method as might be moſt comprehenſive of thoſe things which we deſigned to explain our ſenſe, and belief of; and finding no defect, in this regard, in that fixed on by the aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, and after them by thoſe of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational
<pb facs="tcp:42012:4"/> way, we did readily con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it beſt to retain the ſame <hi>order</hi> in our preſent confeſſion: and alſo, when we obſerved that thoſe laſt mentioned, did in their confeſſion (for reaſons which ſeemed of weight both to themſelves and others) chooſe not only to expreſs their mind in words concurrent with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer in ſenſe, concerning all thoſe articles wherein they were agreed, but alſo for the moſt part without any variation of the terms we did in like manner conclude it beſt to follow their example in making uſe of the very ſame words with them both, in theſe articles (which are very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny) wherein our faith and doctrine is the ſame with theirs, and this we did, the more abundantly, to manifeſt our conſent with both, in all the fundamental articles of the Chriſtian Religion; as alſo with ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others, whoſe orthodox confeſſions have been publiſhed to the world; on the behalf of the Proteſtants in divers Nations and Cities: and alſo to convince all, that we have no itch to clogge Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion with new words, but do readily
<pb facs="tcp:42012:4"/> acquieſce in that form of ſound words, which hath been, in conſent with the holy Scriptures, uſed by others before us; hereby declaring before God, Angels, &amp; Men, our hearty agreement with them, in that wholeſome Proteſtant Doctrine, which with ſo clear evidence of Scriptures they have aſſerted: ſome things indeed, are in ſome places added, ſome terms o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and ſome few changed, but theſe alterations are of that nature, as that we need not doubt, any charge or ſuſpition of unſoundneſs in the faith, from any of our brethren upon the account of them.</p>
            <p>In thoſe things wherein we differ from others, we have expreſt our ſelves with all candor and plainneſs that none might entertain jealouſie of ought ſecretly lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in our breaſts, that we would not the world ſhould be acquainted with; yet we hope we have alſo obſerved thoſe rules of modeſty, and humility, as will render our freedom in this reſpect in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offenſive, even to thoſe whoſe ſentiments are different from ours.</p>
            <p>We have alſo taken care to affix texts
<pb facs="tcp:42012:5"/> of Scripture, in the margin for the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmation of each article in our confeſſion, in which work we have ſtudiouſly indea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to ſelect ſuch as are moſt clear and pertinent, for the proof of what is aſſerted by us: and our earneſt deſire is, that all into whoſe hands this may come, would follow that (never enough commended) example of the noble <hi>Bere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who ſearched the Scriptures daily, that they might find out whether the things preached to them were ſo or not.</p>
            <p>There is one thing more which we ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely profeſſe, and earneſtly deſire cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in, <hi>viz.</hi> That contention is moſt remote from our deſign in all that we have done in this matter: and we hope the liberty of an ingenuous unfolding our principles, and opening our hearts unto our Brethren, with the Scripture grounds on which our faith and practiſe leanes, will by none of them be either denyed to us, or taken ill from us. Our whole deſign is accompliſhed, if we may obtain that Juſtice, as to be meaſured in our principles, and practiſe, and the
<pb facs="tcp:42012:5"/> judgement of both by others, according to what we have now publiſhed; which the Lord (whoſe eyes are as a flame of fire) knoweth to be the doctrine, which with our hearts we muſt firmly believe, and ſincerely indeavour to conform our lives to. And oh that other contentions being laid aſleep, the only care and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of all upon whom the name of our bleſſed Redeemer is called, might for the future be, to walk humbly with their God, and in the exerciſe of all Love and Meekneſs towards each other, to perfect holyneſs in the fear of the Lord, each one endeavouring to have his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation ſuch as becometh the Goſpel; and alſo ſuitable to his place and capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty vigorouſly to promote in others the practice of true Religion and undefiled in the ſight of God and our Father. And that in this backſliding day, we might not ſpend our breath in fruitleſs complaints of the evils of others; but may every one begin at home, to reform in the firſt place our own hearts, and wayes; and then to quicken all that we may have influence
<pb facs="tcp:42012:6"/> upon, to the ſame work; that if the will of God were ſo, none might deceive themſelves, by reſting in, and truſting to, a form of Godlineſs, without the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of it, and inward experience of the efficacy of thoſe truths that are profeſſed by them.</p>
            <p>And verily there is one ſpring and cauſe of the decay of Religion in our day, which we cannot but touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and earneſtly urge a redreſſe of; and that is the neglect of the worſhip of God in Families, by thoſe to whom the charge and conduct of them is committed. May not the groſſe ignorance, and inſtability of many; with the prophaneneſs of others, be juſtly charged upon their Parents and Maſters, who have not trained them up in the way wherein they ought to walk when they were young? but have neglected thoſe frequent and ſolemn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands which the Lord hath laid upon them ſo to catechize, and inſtruct them, that their tender years might be ſeaſoned with the knowledge of the truth of God as revealed in the Scriptures; and alſo by
<pb facs="tcp:42012:6"/> their own omiſſion of Prayer, and other duties of Religion in their families, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ill example of their looſe converſation, have inured them firſt to a neglect, and then contempt of all Piety and Religion? we know this will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe the blindneſs, or wickedneſs of any; but certainly it will fall heavy upon thoſe that have thus been the occaſion thereof; they indeed dye in their ſins; but will not their blood be required of thoſe under whoſe care they were, who yet permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them to go on without <hi>warning,</hi> yea led them into the paths of deſtruction? and will not the diligence of Chriſtians with reſpect to the diſcharge of theſe duties, in ages paſt, riſe up in judgment againſt, and condemn many of thoſe who would be eſteemed ſuch now?</p>
            <p>We ſhall conclude with our earneſt prayer, that the God of all grace, will pour out thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of his holy Spirit upon us, that the profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of truth may be accompanyed with the ſound belief, and diligent practiſe of it by us; that his name may in all things be glorified, through Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt our Lord, <hi>Amen.</hi>

               <p>1. GOD the good <hi>Creator</hi> of all things, in <hi>his</hi> infinite power, and wiſdom, doth <note n="a" place="margin">Heb. 1. 3. Job 38. 11. Iſa. 46 10, 11.

               <p>2. Although in relation to the foreknowledge and <hi>Decree</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> the firſt cauſe, all things come to
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:42012:18"/> paſs <note n="d" place="margin">Act. 2. 23.</note> immutably and infallibly; ſo that there is not any thing, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>falls any <note n="e" place="margin">Pro. 16. 33.</note> by chance, or without <hi>his Providence;</hi> yet by the ſame <hi>Providence</hi> he ordereth them to fall out, according to the nature of ſecond cauſes, either <note n="f" place="margin">Gen. 8. 22.</note> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily, freely, or contingent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
               <p>3. God in <hi>his</hi> ordinary <hi>Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence</hi>

               <p>5. The moſt wiſe, righteous, and gracious <hi>God,</hi> doth oftentimes, leave for a ſeaſon <hi>his</hi> own children to manifold temptations, and the corruptions of their own heart, to chaſtiſe them for their former ſins, or to diſcover unto them the hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den ſtrength of corruption, and deceitſulneſs of their hearts, <note n="p" place="margin">2 Chro. 32. 25, 26. 31. 2 Sam. 24 1. 2 Cor. 12. 7, 8, 9.</note> that they may be humbled; and to raiſe them to a more cloſe, and conſtant dependence for their ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, upon himſelf; and to make them more watchful againſt all future occaſions of ſin, and for

               <p>So that whatſoever befalls any of his elect is by his appointment, for his glory, <note n="q" place="margin">Rom. 8. 28.</note> and their good.</p>
               <p>6. As for thoſe wicked and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>godly men, whom God as a righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous judge, for former ſin doth <note n="r" place="margin">Rom. 1. 24. 26. 28. ch. 11. 7, 8.</note> blind and harden; from them he not only withholdeth his <note n="s" place="margin">Deut. 29. 4.</note> Grace, whereby they might have been inlightned in their under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, and wrought upon in their hearts: But ſometimes alſo withdraweth <note n="t" place="margin">Mat. 13. 12.</note> the gifts which they had, and expoſeth them to ſuch <note n="u" place="margin">Deut. 2. 30.</note> objects as their <hi>corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> makes occaſion of ſin; and withall <note n="x" place="margin">Pſal. 81. 11, 12. 2 Theſ. 2. 10, 11, 12.</note> gives them over to their own luſts, the temptations of the world, and the power of Satan, whereby it comes to paſs, that they <note n="y" place="margin">Exod. 8. 15. 32.

               <pb n="23" facs="tcp:42012:19"/>
               <p>7.

SUch of the Elect as are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted at riper years, having <note n="a" place="margin">Tit. 3. 2, 3, 4, 5.</note> ſometimes lived in the ſtate of nature, and therein ſerved divers luſts and pleaſures, <hi>God</hi> in their <hi>Effectual Calling</hi> giveth them Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Life.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whereas there is none that doth good, and ſinneth <note n="b" place="margin">Eccl. 7. 20.</note> not; and the beſt of men may through the power, and deceitfulneſs of their corruption dwelling in them, with the prevalency of temptation, fall into great ſins, and provocations; God hath in the Covenant of Grace, merciful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly

               <p n="4">4. As Repentance is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued through the whole courſe of our lives, upon the account of the body of death, and the moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thereof; ſo it is every mans duty, to repent of his <note n="g" place="margin">Luk. 19. 8. 1 Tim. 1. 13. 15.</note> particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar known ſins, particularly.</p>

               <p n="5">5. Such is the proviſion which God hath made through Chriſt in the Covenant of Grace, for the preſervation of Believers unto Salvation, that although there is no ſin ſo ſmall, but it deſerves <note n="h" place="margin">Rom. 6. 23.</note> damnation; yet there is no ſin ſo great, that it ſhall bring damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on them that <note n="i" place="margin">Iſ. 1. 16. 18.

               <p n="2">2. Theſe good works, done in obedience to Gods command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, are the fruits, and eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces <note n="c" place="margin">Jam. 2. 18. 22.</note> of a true, and lively faith; and by them Believers manifeſt their <note n="d" place="margin">Pſ. 116. 12, 13.</note> thankfullneſs, ſtrengthen their <note n="e" place="margin">1 Joh. 2 3. 5. 2 Pet. 1. 5-11.</note> aſſurance, edifie their <note n="f" place="margin">Mat. 5. 16.</note> brethren, adorn the profeſſion of the Goſpel, ſtop the mouths of the adverſaries and glorifie <note n="g" place="margin">1 Tim. 6. 1. 1 Pet. 2. 15.

               <p n="3">3. Their ability to do good works, is not at all of themſelves; but wholly from the <hi>Spirit</hi> 
                  <note n="k" place="margin">Joh. 15. 4. 6.</note> of Chriſt; and that they may be ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled thereunto, beſides the graces they have already received, there is neceſſary an <note n="l" place="margin">2 Cor. 3. 5.

Gal. 5. 17. Luk. 17. 10.</note> they fall ſhort of much which in duty they are bound to do.</p>
               <p n="5">5. We cannot by our beſt works merit pardon of Sin or Eternal Life at the hand of God, by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the great diſproportion that is between them and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to come; and the infinite di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that is between us and God, whom by them we can neither profit, nor ſatisfie for the debt of our <note n="o" place="margin">Rom. 3. 20. Eph. 2. 8, 9. Rom. 4. 6.</note> former ſins; but when we
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:42012:35"/> have done all we can, we have done but our duty, and are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>profitable ſervants; and becauſe as they are good they proceed from his <note n="p" place="margin">Gal. 5. 22, 23.</note> Spirit, and as they are wrought by us they are defil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed <note n="q" place="margin">Iſa. 64. 6. Pſ. 143 2.</note> and mixed with ſo much weakneſs and imperfection that they cannot endure the ſeverity of Gods judgement.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Yet notwithſtanding the perſons of Believers being accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through Chriſt their good works alſo are accepted in <note n="r" place="margin">Eph. 1. 6. 1 Pet. 2. 5.</note> him; not as though they were in this life wholly unblameable and unreprovable in Gods ſight; but that he looking upon them in his Son is pleaſed to accept and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward that which is <note n="s" place="margin">Mat. 25. 21. 23.

               <p n="7">7. Works done by unregene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate men although for the matter

This certainty is not abare conjectural, and probable perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, grounded upon <note n="d" place="margin">Heb. 6. 11. 19.</note> a fallible hope; but an infallible aſſurance of faith founded on the Blood and Righteouſneſs of Chriſt <note n="e" place="margin">Heb. 6. 17, 18.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed in the Goſpel; and alſo upon the inward <note n="f" place="margin">2 Pet. 1. 4, 5, 10. 11.</note> evidence of thoſe graces of the Spirit unto which promiſes are made, and on the teſtimony of the <note n="g" place="margin">Rom. 8. 15, 16.</note> Spirit of adoption, witneſſing with our Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits that we are the children of God; and as a fruit thereof keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the heart both <note n="h" place="margin">1 Joh. 3 1, 2, 3.</note> humble and holy.</p>

            <head>AN APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>WHoſoever reads, and impartially conſiders what we have in our forgoing confeſſion declared, may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily perceive, That we do not only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>center with all other true Chriſtians on the Word of God (revealed in the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth) as the foundation and rule of our faith and worſhip. But that we have alſo induſtriouſly endeavoured to manifeſt, That in the fundamental Articles of Chriſtianity we mind the ſame things, and have therefore expreſſed our belief in the ſame words, that have on the like occaſion been ſpoken by other ſocieties of Chriſtians before us.</p>
            <p>This we have done, That thoſe who are deſirous to know the principles of Religion which we hold and practiſe,
<pb n="110" facs="tcp:42012:63"/> may take an eſtimate from our ſelves (who jointly concur in this work) and may not be miſguided, either by undue reports; or by the ignorance or errors of particular perſons, who going under the ſame name with our ſelves, may give an occaſion of ſcandalizing the truth we profeſs.</p>
            <p>And although we do differ from our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren who are Paedobaptiſts; in the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject and adminiſtration of Baptiſme, and ſuch other circumſtances as have a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary dependence on our obſervance of that Ordinance, and do frequent our own aſſemblies for our mutual edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and diſcharge of thoſe duties, and ſervices which we owe unto God, and in his fear to each other: yet we would not be from hence miſconſtrued, as if the diſcharge of our own conſciences herein, did any wayes diſoblige or alienate our affections, or converſation from any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers that fear the Lord; but that we may and do as we have opportunity par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticipate of the labors of thoſe, whom God hath indued with abilities above
<pb n="111" facs="tcp:42012:63"/> our ſelves, and qualified, and called to the Miniſtry of the <hi>Word,</hi> earneſtly deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to approve our ſelves to be ſuch, as follow after peace with holyneſs, and therefore we alwaies keep that bleſſed <hi>Irenicum,</hi> or healing <hi>Word</hi> of the Apoſtle before our eyes; if in any thing ye be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto you; nevertheleſs whereto we have already attained; let us walk by the ſame rule, let us mind the ſame thing, <hi>Phil. 3. v.</hi> 15, 16.</p>
            <p>Let it not therefore be judged of us (becauſe much hath been written on this ſubject, and yet we continue this our practiſe different from others) that it is out of obſtinacy, but rather as the truth is, that we do herein according to the beſt of our underſtandings worſhip God, out of a pure mind yielding obedience to his precept, in that method which we take to be moſt agreeable to the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of truth, and primitive practiſe.</p>
            <p>It would not become us to give any ſuch intimation, as ſhould carry a ſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance that what we do in the ſervice of
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:42012:64"/> God is with a doubting conſcience, or with any ſuch temper of mind that we do thus for the preſent, with a reſervation that we will do otherwiſe hereafter upon more mature deliberation; nor have we any cauſe ſo to do, being fully perſwad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that what we do is agreeable to the will of God. Yet we do heartily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe this, that if any of the Servants of our Lord Jeſus ſhall, in the Spirit of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, attempt to convince us of any mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtake either in judgement or practiſe, we ſhall diligently ponder his arguments; and accompt him our chiefeſt friend that ſhall be an inſtrument to convert us from any error that is in our ways, for we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not wittingly do any thing againſt the truth, but all things for the truth.</p>
            <p>And therefore we have indeavoured ſeriouſly to conſider, what hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready offered for our ſatisfaction in this point; and are loth to ſay any more leſt we ſhould be eſteemed deſirous of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed conteſts thereabout: yet foraſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as it may juſtly be expected that we ſhew ſome reaſon, why we cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:42012:64"/> in what hath been urged againſt us; we ſhall with as much brevity as may conſiſt with plainneſs, endeavour to ſatisfie the expectation of thoſe that ſhall peruſe what we now publiſh in this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo.</p>
            <p>1. As to thoſe Chriſtians who conſent with us, <hi>That Repentance from dead works, and Faith towards God, and our Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, is required in perſons to be Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed;</hi> and do therefore ſupply the defect of the (infant being uncapable of making confeſſion of either) by others who do undertake theſe things for it. Although we do find by Church hiſtory that this hath been a very antient pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe;<note place="margin">Rom. 14. 4. 10. 12. 23.</note> yet conſidering, that the ſame Scripture which does caution us againſt cenſuring our brother, with whom we ſhall all ſtand before the judgment ſeat of Chriſt, does alſo inſtruct us, <hi>That every one of us ſhall give an accompt of himſelf to God,</hi> and <hi>what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever is not of Faith is ſin.</hi> Therefore we cannot for our own parts be perſwaded in our own minds, to build ſuch a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:42012:65"/> as this, upon an unwritten tradition: But do rather chooſe in all points of Faith and Worſhip, to have recourſe to the holy Scriptures, for the information of our judgment, and regulation of our practiſe; being well aſſured that a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcientious attending thereto, is the beſt way to prevent, and rectifie our defects and errors. 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. 16, 17. And if any ſuch caſe happen to be debated between Chriſtians, which is not plainly determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable by the Scriptures, we think it ſafeſt to leave ſuch things undecided until the ſecond coming of our Lord Jeſus; as they did in the Church of old, until there ſhould ariſe a Prieſt with <hi>
                  <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>rim</hi> and <hi>Thum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mim,</hi> that might certainly inform them of the mind of God thereabout, <hi>Ezra</hi> 2. 62, 63.</p>
            <p>2. As for thoſe our Chriſtian brethren who do ground their arguments for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fants baptiſm, upon a preſumed foederal Holineſs, or Church-Memberſhip, we conceive they are deficient in this, that albeit this Covenant-Holineſs and Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berſhip ſhould be as is ſuppoſed, in refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence
<pb n="115" facs="tcp:42012:65"/> unto the Infants of Believers; yet no command for Infant baptiſm does im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately and directly reſult from ſuch a quality, or relation.</p>
            <p>All inſtituted Worſhip receives its ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction from the precept, and is to be thereby governed in all the neceſſary cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances thereof.</p>
            <p>So it was in the Covenant that God made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his Seed. The ſign whereof was appropriated only to the Male, notwithſtanding that the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male ſeed as well as the Male were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the Covenant and part of the Church of God; neither was this ſign to be affixed to any Male Infant till he was eight dayes old, albeit he was within the Covenant from the firſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his life; nor could the danger of death, or any other ſuppoſed neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, warrant the circumciſing of him be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſet time, nor was there any cauſe for it; the commination of being cut off from his people, being only upon the neglect, or contempt of the precept.</p>
            <pb n="116" facs="tcp:42012:66"/>
            <p>Righteous <hi>Lot</hi> was nearly related to <hi>Aqraham</hi> in the fleſh, and contemporary with him, when this Covenant was made; yet inaſmuch as he did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcend from his loynes, nor was of his houſhold family (although he was of the ſame houſhold of faith with <hi>Abraham</hi>) yet neither <hi>Lot</hi> himſelf nor any of his poſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity (becauſe of their deſcent from him) were ſigned with the ſignature of this Covenant that was made with <hi>Abraham</hi> and his ſeed.</p>
            <p>This may ſuffice to ſhew, that where there was both an expreſſe Covenant, and a ſign thereof (ſuch a Covenant as did ſeparate the perſons with whom it was made, and all their off-ſpring from all the reſt of the world, as a people holy unto the Lord, and did conſtitute them the viſible Church of God, (though not comprehenſive of all the faithful in the world) yet the ſign of this Covenant was not affixed to all the perſons that were within this Covenant, nor to any of them till the prefixt ſeaſon; nor to other faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſervants of God, that were not of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent
<pb n="117" facs="tcp:42012:66"/> from <hi>Abraham.</hi> And conſequently that it depends purely upon the will of the Law-giver, to determine what ſhall be the ſign of his Covenant, unto whom, at what ſeaſon, and upon what terms, it ſhall be affixed.</p>
            <p>If our brethren do ſuppoſe baptiſm to be the ſeal of the Covenant which God makes with every beleiver (of which the Scriptures are altogether ſilent) it is not our concern to contend with them here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; yet we conceive the ſeal of that Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant is the indwelling of the Spirit of Chriſt in the particular and individual perſons in whom he reſides, and nothing elſe, neither do they or we ſuppoſe that baptiſm is in any ſuch manner ſubſtituted in the place of circumciſion, as to have the ſame (and no other) latitude, extent, or terms, then circumciſion had; for that was ſuited only for the Male children, baptiſm is an ordinance ſuited for every beleiver, whether male, or femal. That extended to all the maies that were born in <hi>Abrahams</hi> houſe, or bought with his money, equally with the males that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded
<pb n="118" facs="tcp:42012:67"/> from his own loynes; but bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme is not ſo far extended in any true Chriſtian Church that we know of, as to be adminiſtred to all the poor infidel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, that the members thereof purchaſe for their ſervice, and introduce into their families; nor to the children born of them in their houſe.</p>
            <p>But we conceive the ſame parity of reaſoning may hold for the ordinance of baptiſm as for that of circumciſion; <hi>Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odus 12. 49. viz.</hi> one law for the ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, as for the home born: If any deſire to be admitted to all the ordinances, and priviledges of Gods houſe, the door is open; upon the ſame terms that any one perſon was ever admitted to all, or any of thoſe priviledges, that belong to the Chriſtian Church; may all perſons of right challenge the like admiſſion.</p>
            <p>As for that text of Scripture, Rom. 4. 11. <hi>He received circumciſion a ſeal of the righteouſneſs of the faith which he had yet being uncircumciſed;</hi> we conceive if the Apoſtles ſcope in that place be duly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, it will appear that no argument
<pb n="119" facs="tcp:42012:67"/> can be taken from thence to inforce In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm; and foraſmuch as we find a full and fair account of thoſe words gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven by the learned Dr. <hi>Lightfoot</hi> (a man not to be ſuſpected of partiality in this controverſie) in his <hi>Hor. Hebrai,</hi> on the 1 <hi>Cor. 7. 19. p.</hi> 42, 43. we ſhall tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe his words at large, without any comment of our own upon them.</p>

            <p>Thus far he, which we earneſtly deſire may be ſeriouſly weighed, for we plead not his authority, but the evidence of truth in his words.</p>
            <p>3. Of whatſoever nature the holineſs of the children mentioned, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7. 12. be, yet they who do conclude that all ſuch children (whether Infants or of riper years) have from hence an immediate right to baptiſm, do as we conceive put more into the concluſion, then will be found in the premiſſes.</p>
            <p>For although we do not determine po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitively concerning the Apoſtles ſcope in the holineſs here mentioned, ſo as to ſay it is this, or that, and no other thing; Yet it is evident that the Apoſtle does by it determine not only the lawfulneſs but the expedience alſo of a beleivers coha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation with an unbeliever, in the ſtate of marriage.</p>
            <p>And we do think that although the Apoſtles aſſerting of the unbelieving
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:42012:71"/> yokefellow to be ſanctified by the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever, ſhould carry in it ſomewhat more then is in the bare marriage of two infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels, becauſe although the marriage cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant have a divine ſanction ſo as to make the wedlock of two unbelievers a lawful action, and their conjunction and cohabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in that reſpect undefiled, yet there might be no ground to ſuppoſe from thence, that both or either of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are thereby ſanctified; and the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle urges the cohabitation of a believer with an infidel in the ſtate of wedlock from this ground that the unbelieving husband is <hi>ſanctified</hi> by the believing wife; nevertheleſs here you have the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of a believers faith <hi>aſcending from an inferior to a ſuperior relation;</hi> from the wife to the husband who is her head, <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can deſcend to their off-ſpring.</hi> And therefore we ſay, whatever be the nature or extent of the holineſs here intended, we conceive it cannot convey to the children an immediate right to baptiſm; becauſe it would then be of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and of a larger extent, then the root,
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:42012:71"/> and original from whence it is derived; for it is clear by the Apoſtles argument that holineſs cannot be derived to the child from the ſanctity of one parent on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if either father or mother be (in the ſenſe intended by the Apoſtle) unholy or unclean, ſo will the child be alſo, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore for the production of an holy ſeed it is neceſſary that both the Parents be ſanctified; and this the Apoſtle poſitive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerts in the firſt place to be done by the beleiving parent, although the other be an unbeliever; and then conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from thence argues, the holineſs of their children. Hence it follows, that as the children have no other holineſs then what they derive from both their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents; ſo neither can they have any right by this holineſs to any ſpiritual privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge but ſuch as both their Parents did alſo partake of: and therefore if the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>believing Parent (though ſanctified by the believing Parent) have not thereby a a right to baptiſm, neither can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieve, that there is any ſuch priviledge, derived to the children by their birth-ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs.</p>
            <pb n="128" facs="tcp:42012:72"/>
            <p>Beſides if it had been the uſual practiſe in the Apoſtles dayes for the father or mother that did beleive, to bring all their children with them to be baptiſed; then the holineſs of the beleiving <hi>Corinthians</hi> children, would not at all have been in queſtion when this Epiſtle was written; but might have been argued from their paſſing under that ordinance, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented their new birth, although they had derived no holineſs from their Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, by their firſt birth; and would have layen as an exception againſt the Apoſtles inference, <hi>elſe were your Children unclean,</hi> &amp;c. But of the ſanctification of all the children of every beleiver by this ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or any other way, then what is beforementioned, the Scripture is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether ſilent.</p>
            <p>This may be alſo added; that if this birth holineſs do qualifie all the children of every believer, for the ordinance of baptiſm; why not for all other ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances? for the Lords Supper as was pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed for a long time together? for if re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe be had to what the Scriptures
<pb n="129" facs="tcp:42012:72"/> ſpeak generally of this ſubject; it will be found, that the ſame qualities which do intitle any perſon to baptiſm, do ſo alſo for the participation of all the Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, and priviledges of the houſe of God, that are common to all believers.</p>
            <p>Whoſoever can and does interrogate his good Conſcience towards God when he is baptiſed (as every one muſt do that makes it to himſelf a ſign of Salvation) is capable of doing the ſame thing, in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry other act of worſhip that he performs.</p>
            <p>4. The arguments and inferences that are uſually brought for, or againſt In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant baptiſm from thoſe few inſtances which the Scriptures afford us of whole families being baptiſed; are only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectural; and therefore cannot of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, be concluſive on either hand: yet in regard moſt that treat on this ſubject for Infant baptiſm, do (as they conceive) improve theſe inſtances to the advantage of their argument: we think it meet (in like manner as in the caſes before menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned ſo in this) to ſhew the invalidity of ſuch inferences.</p>

            <p>Who can aſſign any probable reaſon, why the Apoſtle ſhould make mention of four or five houſholds being baptiſed and no more? or why he does ſo often vary in the method of his ſalutations, <hi>Rom.</hi> 1. 6. ſometimes mentioning only particular perſons of great note, other times ſuch, and the Church in their houſe? the Saints that were with them; and them belonging to <hi>Narciſſus,</hi> who were in the Lord; thus ſaluting either whole families, or part of families, or only particular perſons in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies,

Wee do freely confeſſe our ſelves guilty before the Lord, in that we have not with more circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpection and diligence train'd up thoſe that relate to us in the fear of the Lord;
<pb n="132" facs="tcp:42012:74"/> and do humbly and earneſtly pray, that our omiſſions herein may be remitted, and that they may not redound to the prejudice of our ſelves, or any of ours: but with reſpect to that duty that is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent on us, we acknowledge our ſelves obliged by the precepts of God, to bring up our children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, to teach them his fear, both by inſtruction and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample; and ſhould we ſet light by this precept, it would demonſtrate that we are more vile then the unnatural Heathen, that like not to retain God in their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, our baptiſm might then be juſtly accompted, as no baptiſm to us.</p>
            <p>There are many ſpecial promiſes that do incourage us as well as precepts, that do oblige us to the cloſe purſuit of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty herein: that God whom we ſerve, being jealous of his Worſhip, threatens the viſiting of the Fathers tranſgreſſion upon the children to the third and fourth generation of them that hate him: yet does more abundantly extend his mercy, even to thouſands (reſpecting the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:42012:74"/> and ſucceding generations) of them that love him, and keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>When our Lord rebuked his diſciples for prohibiting the acceſs of little chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren that were brought to him, that he might pray over them, lay his hands up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, and bleſſe them, does declare, <hi>that of ſuch is the Kingdom of God.</hi> And the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in anſwer to their enquiry, that deſired to know what they muſt do to be ſaved, does not only inſtruct them in the neceſſary duty of repentance and baptiſm; but does alſo thereto encourage them, by that promiſe which had refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence both to them, and their children; if our Lord Jeſus in the forementioned place, do not reſpect the qualities of children (as elſewhere) as to their meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, humility, and ſincerity, and the like; but intend alſo that thoſe very perſons and ſuch like, appertain to the Kingdom of God, and if the Apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> in men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the aforeſaid promiſe, do reſpect not only the preſent and ſucceeding ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations of thoſe Jews, that heard him,
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:42012:75"/> (in which ſenſe the ſame phraſe doth oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curre in Scripture) but alſo the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate off-ſpring of his auditors; whether the promiſe relate to the gift of the Holy Spirit, or of eternal life, or any grace, or priviledge tending to the obtaining thereof; it is neither our concerne nor our intereſt to confine the mercies, and promiſes of God, to a more narrow, or leſſe compaſſe then he is pleaſed grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to offer and intend them; nor to have a light eſteem of them; but are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged in duty to God, and affection to our children; to plead earneſtly with God and uſe our utmoſt endeavours that both our ſelves, and our off-ſpring may be partakers of his Mercies and gracious Promiſes: yet we cannot from either of theſe texts collect a ſufficient warrant for us to baptize our children before they are inſtructed in the principles of the Chriſtian Religion.</p>
            <p>For as to the inſtance in little children, it ſeems by the diſciples forbidding them, that they were brought upon ſome other account, not ſo frequent as Baptiſm muſt
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:42012:75"/> be ſuppoſed to have been, if from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning believers children had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted thereto: and no account is given whether their parents were baptiſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers or not; and as to the inſtance of the Apoſtle; if the following words and practiſe, may be taken as an interpretati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the ſcope of that promiſe we cannot conceive it does refer to infant baptiſm, becauſe the text does preſently ſubjoyn; <hi>Then they that gladly received the word were baptiſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That there were ſome believing chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of believing parents in the Apoſtles dayes is evident from the Scriptures, even ſuch as were then in ther fathers family, and under their parents tuition, and edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; to whom the Apoſtle in ſeveral of his Epiſtles to the Churches, giveth commands to obey their parents in the Lord; and does allure their tender years to hearken to this precept, by reminding them that it is the firſt command with promiſe.</p>
            <p>And it is recorded by him for the praiſe of <hi>Timothy,</hi> and encouragement of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:42012:76"/> betimes to inſtaruct, and children early to attend to godly inſtruction, that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

            <p>The Apoſtle <hi>John</hi> rejoyced greatly when he found of the children of the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect Lady walking in the truth; and the children of her Elect Siſter joyn with the Apoſtle in his ſalutation.</p>
            <p>But that this was not generally ſo, that all the children of believers were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for believers (as they would have been if they had been all baptiſed) may be collected from the character which the Apoſtle gives of perſons fit to be choſen to Elderſhip in the Church which was not common to all believers; among o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers this is expreſſely one, <hi>viz. If there be any having believing, or faithful chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> not accuſed of Riot or unruly; and we may from the Apoſtles writings on the ſame ſubject collect the reaſon of this qualification, <hi>viz.</hi> That in caſe the perſon deſigned for this office to teach and rule in the houſe of God, had children capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it; there might be firſt a proof of
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:42012:76"/> his ability, induſtry, and ſucceſſe in this work in his own family; and private ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, before he was ordained to the exerciſe of this authority in the Church, in a publick capacity, as a Biſhop in the houſe of God.</p>
            <p>Theſe things we have mentioned as having a direct reference unto the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſie between our brethren and us; other things that are more abſtruſe and prolix, which are frequently introduced into this controverſie, but do not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily concern it, we have purpoſely a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voided; that the diſtance between us and our brethren may not be by us made more wide; for it is our duty, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ſo far as is poſſible for us (retaining a good conſcience towards God) to ſeek a more entire agreement and reconciliati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with them.</p>
            <p>We are not inſenſible that as to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Gods houſe, and entire communion therein there are ſome things wherein we (as well as others) are not at a full accord among our ſelves, as for inſtance; the
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:42012:77"/> known principle, and ſtate of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of diverſe of us, that have agreed in this Confeſſion is ſuch; that we can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not hold Church-communion, with any other then Baptized-believers, and Churches conſtituted of ſuch; yet ſome others of us have a greater liberty and freedom in our ſpirits that way; and therefore we have purpoſely omitted the mention of things of that nature, that we might concurre, in giving this evidence of our agreement, both among our ſelves, and with other good Chriſtians, in thoſe important articles of the Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, mainly inſiſted on by us: and this notwithſtanding we all eſteem it our chief concern, both among our ſelves, and all others that in every place call upon the name of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, both theirs and ours, and love him in ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, to endeavour to keep the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace; and in order thereunto, to exerciſe all lowli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and meekneſs, with long-ſuffering, forbearing one another in love.</p>
            <p>And we are perſwaded if the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:42012:77"/> were introduced into frequent pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe between us and our Chriſtian friends who agree with us in all the fundamental articles of the Chriſtian faith (though they do not ſo in the ſubject and admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration of baptiſm) it would ſoon beget a better underſtanding, and brotherly affection between us.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the Chriſtian Church, when the doctrine of the baptiſm of <hi>Chriſt</hi> was not univerſally underſtood, yet thoſe that knew only the baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> were the Diſciples of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus; and <hi>Apollos</hi> an eminent Miniſter of the Goſpel of Jeſus.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of the reformation of the Chriſtian Church, and recovery from that <hi>Egyptian</hi> darkneſs wherein our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers for many generations were held in bondage; upon recourſe had to the Scriptures of truth, different apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were conceived, which are to this time continued, concerning the practiſe of this Ordinance.</p>
            <p>Let not our zeal herein be miſinterpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted: that God whom we ſerve is jealous
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:42012:78"/> of his worſhip. By his gracious provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence the Law thereof, is continued a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; and we are forewarned by what hapned in the Church of the Jews, that it is neceſſary for every generation, and that frequently in every generation to conſult the divine oracle, compare our worſhip with the rule, and take heed to what doctrines we receive and pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſe.</p>
            <p>If the ten commands exhibited in the popiſh Idolatrous ſervice books had been received as the entire law of God, becauſe they agree in number with his ten commands, and alſo in the ſubſtance of nine of them; the ſecond Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment forbidding Idolatry had been ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly loſt.</p>
            <p>If <hi>Ezra</hi> and <hi>Nehemiah</hi> had not made a diligent ſearch into the particular parts of Gods law, and his worſhip; the Feaſt of Tabernacles (which for many centuries of years, had not been duly obſerved, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the inſtitution, though it was retained in the general notion) would not have been kept in due order.</p>
            <pb n="141" facs="tcp:42012:78"/>
